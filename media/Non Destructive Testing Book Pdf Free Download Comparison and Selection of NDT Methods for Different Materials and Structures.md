Non destructive testing (NDT) is a technique of inspecting, testing, or evaluating materials, components or assemblies for discontinuities, or differences in characteristics without destroying the serviceability of the part or system. NDT is widely used in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, nuclear, and civil engineering.
 
There are many books and publications that cover the principles, methods, applications, and limitations of NDT. However, some of them may be expensive or hard to access. Fortunately, there are also some free online resources that can help you learn more about NDT and enhance your skills and knowledge. Here are some of them:

NDT methods can be classified into two categories: volumetric and surface. Volumetric methods can detect defects or discontinuities inside the material, such as cracks, voids, porosity, inclusions, or delaminations. Surface methods can detect defects or discontinuities on the surface of the material, such as corrosion, wear, scratches, or coating defects.

Some of the most common NDT methods are:

- **Liquid penetrant testing (LPT)**. This method involves applying a liquid with high surface wetting characteristics to the surface of the material. The liquid penetrates into any surface openings and is then removed from the surface. A developer is then applied to draw out the liquid from the openings and create a visible indication of the defect.
- **Magnetic particle testing (MPT)**. This method involves magnetizing the material and applying fine magnetic particles to the surface. The particles are attracted to any areas where the magnetic field is distorted by a defect and form a visible indication of the defect.
- **Eddy current testing (ECT)**. This method involves inducing an alternating current in a coil and placing it near the surface of the material. The coil generates an eddy current in the material that is affected by any defect or change in conductivity. The coil detects any change in the eddy current and produces a signal that indicates the presence and location of the defect.
- **Radiography (RT)**. This method involves exposing the material to a source of radiation, such as X-rays or gamma rays, and placing a film or detector behind the material. The radiation passes through the material and is attenuated by any defect or variation in density. The film or detector records the image of the radiation that passes through the material and shows any defect as a darker or lighter area.
- **Ultrasonic testing (UT)**. This method involves sending high-frequency sound waves into the material and receiving them back after they reflect from any defect or boundary. The time, amplitude, and frequency of the reflected waves are analyzed to determine the presence, location, size, and orientation of the defect.
