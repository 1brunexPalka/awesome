The Night World series by L.J. Smith is a popular young adult fantasy series that consists of nine books and one planned final book. The series follows the lives of various supernatural beings who live in a secret society called the Night World. The Night World has its own rules and laws, and forbids its members from falling in love with humans or revealing their existence to them. However, some of the Night World characters break these rules and form bonds with human characters, leading to conflicts and dangers.
 
The final book, Strange Fate, is supposed to wrap up the series and reveal the secrets of the Night World. The book will feature three stories that are connected by a common theme: the apocalypse. The book will also introduce new characters and bring back old ones, as well as explore the origins and history of the Night World. The book will also reveal the identity and role of the Wild Power, a mysterious figure who is prophesied to save or destroy the world.
 
Strange Fate has been eagerly anticipated by fans since the publication of the ninth book, Witchlight, in 1998. However, the book has been delayed for various reasons, such as the author's health issues, personal problems, and creative challenges. The author has assured fans that she is still working on the book and that she hopes to finish it soon. She has also shared some snippets and teasers of the book on her website and social media accounts.
